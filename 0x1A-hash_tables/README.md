0x1A. C - Hash tables

A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, though there are some hash functions that support variable length output

a hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that implements an associative array, also called a dictionary, which is an abstract data type that maps keys to values.
